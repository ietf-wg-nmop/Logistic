IAB workshop on the Next Era of Network Management Operations  (NEMOps)

# Introduction

The IAB organized a workshop (June 4-June 6, 2002) to establish a
dialog between network operators and protocol developers, and to guide
the IETF's focus when working on network management protocols. The
outcome of that workshop was documented in the "IAB Network Management
Workshop" [RFC3535] and identified 14 recommendations for
consideration in future network management protocol designs.

Those requirements were instrumental for developing first the NETCONF
protocol (in the NETCONF Working Group) [RFC6241], the associated YANG
data modeling language (in the NETMOD Working Group) [RFC7950], 
RESTCONF [RFC8040], and most recently CORECONF.

This workshop is expected to concentrate on multiple topics, including
a historical recap of the results from the last workshop, what the
current state of the art and deployment looks like today, what are the recommendations that were not followed, and what are
the hurdles that are were encountered when operationalizing the recommendations.

# Review of the past workshop results

This IAB workshop will look at whether these recommendations were met,
and (more importantly) gather new input on what new issues network
operators and network management implementers are facing.  This
workshop ambitions to lay a new directional foundation for the continued
future of network management protocols.  Recommendations that come out
of this effort are expected to be helpful to the global industry, including the IETF, the IRTF, and
implementers, operational groups, and other bodies.

# Current state of the art

Taking into account the [RFC3535] recommendations, what do
implementations and deployments look like today? If there are hurdles
towards implementation, what are they?  Are operators deploying
solutions containing IETF network management standards, and if not, do
operators think that specifications are missing key features or
requirements? Are there alternate solutions that better fit the operators needs? Etc.

# Laying a path for the future of Network Management

Network topologies have become significantly more complex since the
last workshop, as have the router and host implementations deployed
within them.  Assuming this trend will only be increasing, this
workshop intends to explore what previous recommendations still stand
as unfulfilled, whether they remain relevant, and what new
recommendations exist in the changing landscape.  For example,
configuration management and automation have become increasingly
important to enable large scale rollouts.  What protocols, libraries
and tools are needed to enable network management at scale?  What
balance of open source vs proprietary networks are deployed today, and
which architectures are expected to work continuing forward?

# Out of scope topics

This workshop intends to focus on managing networks within the control
plane (and its effect on the data plane), but management of content
within the data plane is explicitly out of scope.  Specifically, a
workshop relating to management techniques related to encrypted
networks has already been held [RFC9490] and similar topics are out of
scope for this workshop.

# Outreach and Timeline

In 2002, many network operators attended IETF meetings and
participated in network management protocol discussions. Direct
participation of network operators have since dwindled, with many
operators focusing on conferences that are more central to their
needs -- these include RIPE, NANOG, AutoConn etc.

Under this effort we expect to initially have an outreach effort to
attract opinions and interest by visiting these other venues.  This
will be followed by a final virtual workshop for this effort
tentatively set for December of 2024.  Until the final workshop draws
close, the mailing list will be used for interim participation/BoFs at
other conferences, general announcements and any related discussions.
